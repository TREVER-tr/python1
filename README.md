# Python Basics & Intermediate Concepts
A collection of essential Python programs covering fundamental and advanced concepts, including data structures, OOP, recursion, file handling, multithreading, and more.
# Programs Included # day 1 from basics from  1 to 5 topics with sub topics of  membership and identity operators  
ðŸ”¹ 1. Arithmetic Operations
Perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
ðŸ”¹ 2. Comparison Operators
Demonstrates comparison between values using ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Logical Operators
Explores and, or, and not operations on boolean values.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Bitwise Operators
Illustrates binary operations using &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>.
ðŸ”¹ 5. Assignment Operators
Shows how variables are updated using operators like +=, -=, *=, /=.
ðŸ”¹ 6. String Operations
Manipulating text with methods like .upper(), .lower(), .replace(), .split().
# day 2  from basics with intermediate operation like strings,lists,tuples,sets,dictionaries,etc from  7 to 12
ðŸ”¹ 7. Lists, Tuples & Sets 
Working with collections using indexing, sorting, and set operations.
ðŸ”¹ 8. Dictionaries
Demonstrates key-value pairs, dictionary operations, and retrieval methods.
ðŸ”¹ 9. Loops (For & While)
Examples of iterating over lists, using conditions and managing loop flow.
ðŸ”¹ 10. Functions in Python
Defining reusable functions with arguments and return values.
ðŸ”¹ 11. Lambda Functions
Creating one-liner anonymous functions with lambda.
ðŸ”¹ 12. List Comprehensions
Simplifying loop-based list modifications using list comprehensions.
# day 3  its starts from intermediate to advanced level  from  13 to 25 
ðŸ”¹ 13. Exception Handling
Using try-except blocks to gracefully handle runtime errors.
ðŸ”¹ 14. File Handling
Reading and writing files using open(), handling text and structured data.
ðŸ”¹ 15. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Defining classes, objects, and working with encapsulation.
ðŸ”¹ 16. Inheritance in OOP
Extending classes using inheritance principles.
ðŸ”¹ 17. Modules & Importing
Using built-in Python modules like math, random, and custom imports.
ðŸ”¹ 18. Regular Expressions (Regex)
Pattern matching and text searching using the re module.
ðŸ”¹ 19. Multithreading
Creating threads to execute multiple tasks in parallel.
ðŸ”¹ 20. Recursion (Functions Calling Themselves)
Implementing recursive functions like factorial and Fibonacci series.
ðŸ”¹ 21. Map, Filter, and Reduce
Applying functional programming techniques for data processing.
ðŸ”¹ 22. Zip Function
Combining multiple lists element-wise using zip().
ðŸ”¹ 23. Enumerate Function
Looping through lists with index tracking.
ðŸ”¹ 24. Shallow vs Deep Copy
Exploring object copying techniques with copy() and deepcopy().
ðŸ”¹ 25. JSON Handling
Parsing and formatting JSON data for API and storage interactions.
